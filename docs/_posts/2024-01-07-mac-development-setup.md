In 2016 I had my first experience working with a mac, it still had the [infamous touch bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/utkr3o/why_do_people_hate_the_touchbar/), but i was wonderstruck with how nice to use the system was, I always liked linux, but felt that the "user experience" was lacking, even for developers _( we also can have nice things)_. At that time i was not willing to pay for a mac, but then i got a job that provided me with one, i was hooked. Now as a proud owner of a [macbook pro M1](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP858?locale=en_US), i decided to write down my setup, so i can easily replicate it in the future (and if anyone else is interested on it).

+ Processor Apple M1 Max - 10 (8 performance and 2 efficiency)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

source ./antigen.zsh
antigen use oh-my-zsh

antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-completions
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting

antigen apply


plugins=(
    git
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# User configuration

alias ip="ipconfig getifaddr en0" # get machine's ip address
alias sshhome="cd ~/.ssh" # navigate to global ssh directory
alias sshconfig="code --profile=\"victorl2\" ~/.ssh/config && clear" # edit global ssh configuration
alias config="code --profile=\"victorl2\" ~/.zshrc && clear" # edit zsh configuration
alias gcc="gcc-13"
alias g++="g++-13"

eval "$(starship init zsh)"
#THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE FILE FOR SDKMAN TO WORK!!!
